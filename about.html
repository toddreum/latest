        <!-- The Origin Story -->
        <section class="story-section">
            <h2>🎮 How It All Started</h2>
            <p>
                It started with a simple observation that every parent knows too well: kids today are glued to their screens. 
                A father watched as his own teenagers, along with kids everywhere, spent hours scrolling, gaming, and living 
                in their digital worlds. This wasn't just happening in his home—it was happening everywhere, all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                The easy path would have been to fight it. To lecture. To restrict. To confiscate devices and create conflict. 
                But here's the thing about teenagers—the more you push, the more they pull away. The more you fight, the wider 
                the gap becomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                So this dad asked himself a different question: <strong>"What if, instead of fighting what they love, 
                I could reach them through it?"</strong>
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>"If you can't beat 'em... meet them where they are."</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- The Vision -->
        <section class="story-section">
            <h2>💡 The Vision</h2>
            <p>
                The idea was simple but powerful: create a game that's genuinely fun—something kids would actually 
                want to play—but weave in messages of faith, encouragement, and positive values. Not in a preachy way. 
                Not forced. Just naturally part of the experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about it: a kid spends 30 minutes playing BirdTurds, laughing at the chaos, trying to beat their 
                high score. And somewhere in there, a Bible verse pops up. A moment of encouragement. A gentle reminder 
                to take a break and drink some water—or better yet, do some pushups, situps, take a walk outside, 
                get some sunshine and fresh air! Seeds being planted, one at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                And here's the bonus for parents: instead of screen time being a source of guilt and conflict, it becomes 
                something you can feel a little lighter about. Your kid is still gaming, sure—but they're also being 
                exposed to positive messages. That's a win.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <div class="scripture-quote">
            <p>"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."</p>
            <span class="reference">— Proverbs 22:6</span>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Why It Matters -->
        <section class="story-section">
            <h2>❤️ Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>
                We're living in a unique time. Kids have access to more content than any generation before them. 
                They're constantly being influenced—by social media, by games, by content creators. The question isn't 
                whether they'll be influenced. It's <em>what</em> will influence them.
            </p>
            <p>
                BirdTurds is one small answer to that question. It's a fun, silly, slightly ridiculous game about 
                hunting birds and dodging... well, you know. But underneath all that, it's also a vehicle for 
                something more meaningful.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're not trying to replace church or family devotions or real conversations about faith. We're just 
                trying to plant seeds. To meet kids in their world. To make parents smile instead of stress. And maybe, 
                just maybe, to make a small difference in a big, noisy digital world.

            <h2>📱 A Note to Parents</h2>
            <p>
                We get it. The screen time battle is exhausting. The guilt of letting them play "just one more game" 
                is real. The worry about what they're seeing and absorbing online is constant.
            </p>
            <p>
                BirdTurds won't solve all of that. But we hope it helps—even just a little. When your kid is playing 
                our game, you can breathe a bit easier knowing they're getting positive messages mixed in with their fun. 
                They might even learn a Bible verse or two without realizing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And hey—the game has built-in break reminders, hydration prompts, and wellness tips. Because we care 
                about their health, not just their high scores.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #ffd700; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 25px;">
                Thank you for trusting us with your family's screen time. We don't take that lightly.
